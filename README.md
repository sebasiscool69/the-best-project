# Soup & Shelter
This is a collaborative group project from students of the Rutgers bootcamp course.

# Purpose:
The conecpt of the assignment was to create a application that would help solve a word problem. Our group chose to create an application that would allow the user to select whether they would like to find a shelter or soup kitchen locally. We believed this was a way to help a worldwide problem that has been going on for centuries.
