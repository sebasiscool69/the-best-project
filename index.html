            <h3> Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We created this website to help solve a world problem. Over the last year things have been very rough, especially with covid. The goal of this application is to help the user locate a nearby soup kitchen, a shelter, or both if needed. One of the most important things in life is sticking together as a community. 
                As the century's old saying goes,<strong> 'A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link'</strong>. Helping others in need is the best way to persevere through these difficult times and mend this divided country.
